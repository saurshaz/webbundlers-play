# webbundlers-play
A repo to run experiments to best create postable bundles (across different projects)


### Problem ? 
- browserify, webpack, requireJS are great tools as bundlers
- But .. a bundled packet from one shall work in another. Shall it not ? 

That is the target of this one. amongst other experiments and playing


### Startup
- run `npm run dev`
- go to `http://localhost:8098/index.html`

- for stage - run `npm run dist` && `npm run serve` (this will generate main.js into dist/main.js)
